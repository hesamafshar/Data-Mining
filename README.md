# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on data mining projects using various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks and demonstrate practical applications of machine learning models on real-world datasets.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. `BNN/`
- **BNN.ipynb**: Implementation of a Bayesian network model (not a Bayesian Neural Network) for probabilistic inference.
- **insurance.bif**: Bayesian Interchange Format file representing the network structure and probabilities.

### 2. `Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets/`
- This folder contains supervised learning models built to predict the success of marketing campaigns using a banking dataset.
- **Files:**
  - `Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets.csv`: Full dataset.
  - `Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets - Train.csv`, `Test.csv`: Train-test split for model evaluation.
  - **Notebooks:**
    - `DecisionTree.ipynb`: Applies Decision Tree classification.
    - `KNN.ipynb`: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
    - `Logestic_Regression.ipynb`: Logistic Regression model.
    - `SVM.ipynb`: Support Vector Machine classifier.

### 3. `Clustering/`
- Demonstrates unsupervised learning using clustering algorithms.
- **Clustering.ipynb**: Applies K-Means (and potentially others) to customer segmentation.
- **Customers.csv**: Input dataset used for clustering.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Predictive marketing analytics
- Probabilistic inference using Bayesian models

## 📎 Notes
- These projects are educational and exploratory in nature.
